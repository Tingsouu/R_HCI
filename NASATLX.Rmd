This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(readr)

df <- read.csv("Data/NASA_TLX_2.csv")

columns_to_multiply_2 <- c("Mental_Demand_num","Temporal_Demand_num","Physical_Demand_num","Performance_num","Effort_num","Frustration_Level_num")
for (column_name in columns_to_multiply) {
  df[[column_name]] <- df[[column_name]] * 5
}

```{r}

df
df <- df %>% 
mutate(Average = (Mental_Demand  + Temporal_Demand + Physical_Demand  + Performance + Effort   + Frustration_Level )/ 6)

df
```

```{r}
#ANOVA

model <- aov(weight_total ~ condition_road * NDRT + Driving_Distance, data = df) # add another check list 
summary(model)
```
```{r}
model <- aov(Average ~ condition_road * NDRT, data = df)
summary(model)

```

```



```{r}

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
